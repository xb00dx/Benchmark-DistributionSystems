This Document is meant to describe the current status of the Taxonomy Feeders.

11/15/2008: Initial feeders presented as part of the Modern Grid Initiative work for 2008.

3/1/2010: Files were cleaned up for consistency and all feeders were amended to include regulators.  
          Currently these regulators will work in a time-series simulation with the following 
          control methods: MANUAL, OUTPUT_VOLTAGE, and REMOTE_NODE.  

12/8/2010: Added downstream votlage regulators to feeders R1-25.00-1, R2-12.47-2, and R5-12.47-3.  Two 
           regulators were added to R5-12.47-3.  This was done to address some of the low voltage conditions
           that were discovered in the taxonomy feeders during the CVR work for 2010.

1/27/2011: Addressed issue of taxonomy feeders placing all load on L1.  This was changed to represent an even load 
           balance across L12, i.e. 240V load.  Added additonal capacitors, primarly fixed, to finish correction of 
           low voltag levels. 
2/1/2011 : Multiple small sized fixed capacitors added to various feeders.

2/15/2011: Changed all triplex lines from 1/0 to 4/0.  This is a more accruate representation for service drops.
           1/0 is suggested for 120A drops while 4/0 is recommended for 200A drops.
		   
9/24/2012: Removed switch named R4-12-47-1_switch_2 and flipped the from/to orientation of underground line, 
		   R4-12-47-1_ul_2, to remove a loop in R4-12.47-1.glm. The switch named R5-12-47-1_switch_8 was removed 
		   from R5-12.47.glm to remove a loop as well. These changes were made due to a unseen flaw, now caught, when
		   using the forward basksweep powerflow solution method.
